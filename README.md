# FizzioBuddy is a real time video chat app that integrates real time pose detection via Posenet (TensorFlow).
Due to COVID-19, all non-essential healthcare is cancelled or delayed. Most healthcare professionals have moved on to Telehealth inorder to continue to provide services.

This application is a proof of concept to show that existing technologies can be used in novel ways for Telehealth. 

Through pose detection, we can calculate range of motion at each joint. Traditionally, healthcare providers such as Physiotherapist, Occupatinal therapist use tools such as Goniometer to measure range of motion.
These tools could be used during Teleconference (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32190478) 
However, these tools may not be readily available or may not be scalable with changing screen size or may require participants to be in a certain position for prolonged periods of time.
With Posenet, we can potentially eliminate the need for tools to measure range of motion, and it can be scalable for all screen sizes. Additionally, this tool allows the healthcare professional to measure range of motion while the client is relaxed.
